# Solaris Image Packaging System

## Introduction

The Image Packaging System (IPS) is a software delivery system with interaction with a network repository as its primary design goal. Other key ideas are: safe execution for zones and other installation contexts, use of ZFS for efficiency and rollback, preventing the introduction of incorrect or incomplete packages, and efficient use of bandwidth.

## Prerequisites

IPS development requires additional external dependencies, which on Solaris 11 are provided by the list of packages found in src/pkg/external_deps.txt.

## Build, Testing and Deployment

Once all dependency packages are installed, IPS source can be built by the following command:
>       $ cd src; make install

The above will generate a proto directory under the root directory. Inside the proto directory, the build\_i386 directory contains Python version-specific builds; root\_i386 contains the complete build with the directory structure preserved.

Generally, testing of the new build can be done by the following command:
>       $cd src/tests; sudo ./run.py -j 8

The above will run all test cases in 8 parallel processes. Other options are also available by typing `./run.py -h.`

Tests running can also be done by using make:
>       $cd src; sudo make test

Make targets test-27 and test-34 are available for testing specific Python versions.

IPS applications and libraries can be packaged and published into an IPS repository using:
>       $cd src; make packages;

The above command generates IPS related packages and publishes them into packages/i386/repo on an x86-based system.

## Usage Examples

* Example 1 Create an Image With Publisher Configured

    Create a new, full image, with publisher example.com, stored at /aux0/example_root.

>         $ pkg image-create -F -p example.com=http://pkg.example.com:10000 \
>         /aux0/example_root

* Example 2 Create an Image With No Publisher Configured

    Create a new, full image with no publishers configured at /aux0/example_root.

>         $ pkg image-create -F /aux0/example_root

* Example 3 Install a Package

    Install the latest version of the widget package in the current image.

>         $ pkg install application/widget

* Example 4 Add a Publisher

    Add a new publisher example.com, with a repository located at http://www.example.com/repo.

>         $ pkg set-publisher -g http://www.example.com/repo example.com

* Example 5 Add and Automatically Configure a Publisher

    Add a new publisher with a repository located at /export/repo using automatic configuration.

>         $ pkg set-publisher -p /export/repo
